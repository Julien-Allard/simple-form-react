# Simple Form React

A training projet to make and use a form with React.
Informations are stored with states then reused when the form is validated.
In the same way, password and password confirmation are checked to see if they match.

### Main features :

- states
- onChange and onClick event handlers
- ternary conditions
- as always, some nice CSS
